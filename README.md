ok client
=========

The ok client script (written in Python) supports programming projects
by running tests, tracking progress, and assisting in debugging.

your course.

The ok client software was developed for CS 61A at UC Berkeley.

## Developer Instructions

### Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Install [virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
3. Create a virtual environment:

        virtualenv -p python3 .
4. Activate the virtual environment:

        source bin/activate
5. Install requirements:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

## Contributing

Every time you begin, you should activate the virtual environment:

    source bin/activate

All code for the client is found in the `client/` directory.

The `tests/` directory mirrors the directory structure of the `client/`
directory. Every component of the client should have plenty of tests.
To run all tests, use the following command:

    nosetests tests

## Deployment

To deploy a new version of ok-client, do the following:

1. Change the version number in `client/__init__.py`.
2. Make sure your virtualenv is activated. Also make sure that your `~/.pypirc`
   contains okpy's Pypi credentials.
3. From the base of the repo, make sure your virtualenv is activated and run

        python setup.py sdist upload

4. Make sure to deploy a development version locally:

        python setup.py develop

5. Create an `ok` binary:

        ok-publish

6. Draft a new release on Github with the newly created `ok` binary.
